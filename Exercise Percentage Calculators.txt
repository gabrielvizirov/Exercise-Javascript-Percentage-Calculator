Exercise - Javascript Percentage Calculator
15 JUNE 2017 by Mark Price
We have created one type of percentage calculation.

You will build the rest. Have your calculator solve the following questions:

1. What is Y% of X?
2. X is Y% of what?
3. What % of X is Y?
4. X% of what is Y?
5. Y% of X is what?
You can create multiple calculators, or create a dropdown that chooses between the formulas.
